# Chatbot Playground

Draft for skeleton code for students to experiment with different LLM techinques and tools to build a chat-bot in a CS/DS 1 course.

To get started, install and run Docker. Then run

```
docker-compose up
```

The chat interface will be available in localhost:3000. The assignment should be completed in `ai.py`.  This draft is wired with an example simple solution in `ai_openai_solution.py`, using the OpenAI Chat Completions API.
